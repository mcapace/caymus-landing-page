          <h2><strong>No. 1</strong> – Challenging the Status Quo</h2>
          <blockquote>"There's room for both expert voices and everyday enjoyment. Critics offer insight, but the people who drink the wine define its meaning."</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="caymus-point">
          <h2><strong>No. 2</strong> – Consumer-First Thinking</h2>
          <blockquote>"You don't need a glossary to know what tastes good. That's the wine every winery should aim to make; no translation required."</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="caymus-point">
          <h2><strong>No. 3</strong> – Real-World Validation</h2>
          <blockquote>"A packed tasting room and consumer opinion says more to us than a 94-point score ever could."</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="caymus-point">
          <h2><strong>No. 4</strong> – Made to Be Enjoyed</h2>
          <blockquote>"Wines are made to be shared—something that brings people together, not just wines to admire."</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="caymus-point">
          <h2><strong>No. 5</strong> – Gatekeeping vs. Hospitality</h2>
          <blockquote>"When influence turns into ego, wine stops being welcoming. Our role is to help people enjoy what's in the glass, not tell them what to like."</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="caymus-point">
          <h2><strong>No. 6</strong> – Sommelier Culture</h2>
          <blockquote>"Too many wine lists are built to impress other sommeliers, not the guests meant to enjoy the wine."</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="caymus-point">
          <h2><strong>No. 7</strong> – Why We Make Wine</h2>
          <blockquote>"Wines consumers choose again and again build brand loyalty. It's the clearest signal a winery is doing its job."</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="caymus-point">
          <h2><strong>No. 8</strong> – Pride in Popularity</h2>
          <blockquote>"Sometimes the industry treats popularity like it's a flaw. To us, it means we're doing something right."</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="caymus-point">
          <h2><strong>No. 9</strong> – Consistency Over Time</h2>
          <blockquote>"Staying relevant means listening, showing restraint, and the discipline to keep doing what people love, year after year."</blockquote>
        </article>
        <article class="caymus-point">
          <h2><strong>No. 10</strong> – The Future Belongs to the People</h2>
          <blockquote>"The world changes, tastes evolve, and new generations come to the table on their own terms. If wine stays welcoming, focused on enjoyment and brings people together, it stays enduring."</blockquote>
